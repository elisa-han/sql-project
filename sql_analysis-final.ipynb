The packaging (which used to be in branded Fiji colors) is now plain brown with a Fiji label printed on it. I&#x27;ve worked for a commercial printer for many years, and can tell you definitively that the color used in the new packaging is NOT Fiji&#x27;s branded blue color. I don&#x27;t believe a company of Fiji&#x27;s size would deviate from their brand color scheme, there&#x27;s just too much cost put into branding for that to be economically viable. Upon tasting the water, I immediately noticed a difference in taste. I have very hard tap water, so I continued to drink what I purchased (lesser of 2 evils). I just received the latest delivery of the same, plain brown &quot;Fiji&quot; water. I had actually picked up a Fiji bottle from a store on my way home, so I taste tested them.

So I subscribed two boxes (one for 1.5L and another for 500 ml) since they deliver them to your door. Upon opening the box of 500ml water, I felt something was not right immediately. The plastic wrap holding 6 bottles should be in deep blue color, which is the symbol of Fiji water. I found the wrap was just transparent plastic. Then I found one bottle was empty and crooked with the label off the bottle. Besides, all bottles were filled up to the neck level (100%), which is suspicious that bottles seemed to be filled up manually. Typically, bottles are filled up around 95% by automated system. I took pictures to upload here but the website did not allow me for some reason. It looked very suspicious so I decided not to drink it. I will return all two boxes of water. From now on, I would go to the store to buy the &quot;real&quot; Fiji water.</td>\n",

       "        <td>I have been buying this size of Fiji water for our office meetings for several months. However, be very careful with the seller you select for this. I received 6 small bottles (not 6 PACKS) for $17.94. Other sellers sell 6 bottles for anywhere from $5.60 to $7.00 (still expensive for some but the size is great for packing, storing, and avoids half full bottles being left all over the conference room). I thought I was getting a 3 PACKS of 6 bottles. I would even be OK with 2 PACKS of 6 bottles but 6 small bottles for over $17 is not only ridiculous, it is unethical. The seller knows exactly what they are doing. I know it is my own fault for not checking the details, but having done this order multiple times, I never thought they would switch it up on me like this. I will go back to Instacart for future products.</td>\n",
